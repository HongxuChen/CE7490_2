\section{Introduction}

With the development of information technology, data has become more and more important. To safely store the information without losing it due to unpredictable events has become a hot topic. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is a data storage virtualization technology to provide a solution to the issue. It is designed to achievement data redundancy and performance improvement for data storage, by combining multiple physical disk drives to a single logic unit and hiding the implementation details from the users. By using RAID, users can tolerate certain amount of the drive failure. Among all the RAID implementations, RAID 6 is one of the most commonly used architectures in the industry. 
 
In this project, we aim to implement and optimize the RAID 6 to distributedly store the data files across virtual drives.
