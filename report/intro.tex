\section{Introduction}

Nowadays, with the development of information technology, information, stored as data, has become more and more important. To safely store the information without losing it due to unpredictable events has become a hot issue. Redundant Array of Independent Disks(RAID) is a data storage virtualization technology to provide a solution to the issue. It is designed to achievement data redundancy and performance improvement for data storage, by combining multiple physical disk drives to a single logic unit and hiding the implementation details from the users. By using RAID, users can tolerant certain amount of the drive failure.

Among all the RAID implementation, RAID 6 is one of the most commonly used architectures in the industry.  
In this project, we aims to implement and optimize the RAID 6 to distributedly store the data files across virtual drives.
